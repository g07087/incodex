# incodex vier reboot script

About

Python script for rebooting LEIGHTRONIX IncodeX Vier H.264 HD/SD Encoder via web interface. 
Unfortunatley there is no ssh access to the device and I needed it rebooted on a schedule for optimal performance .

It uses selenium's firefox webdriver , as I had issues with chrome and the encoder.
